## Setup Requirements

### For Releases
To use the release workflow, you need to set up the following repository secrets:

1. **GPG_PRIVATE_KEY**: Your GPG private key for signing releases
2. **PASSPHRASE**: The passphrase for your GPG key

#### Setting up GPG for Releases

1. Generate a GPG key if you don't have one:
   ```bash
   gpg --full-generate-key
   ```

2. Export your private key:
   ```bash
   gpg --armor --export-secret-keys YOUR_KEY_ID
   ```

3. Add the exported key to GitHub repository secrets as `GPG_PRIVATE_KEY`
4. Add your passphrase to GitHub repository secrets as `PASSPHRASE`

### For Testing
If you want to run acceptance tests against a real BMLT server, add these secrets:
- `BMLT_HOST`: Your test BMLT server URL
- `BMLT_USERNAME`: Username for authentication
- `BMLT_PASSWORD`: Password for authentication

## Configuration Files

- **`.golangci.yml`**: Configuration for golangci-lint with comprehensive linting rules
- **`.goreleaser.yml`**: GoReleaser configuration for building and releasing
- **`terraform-registry-manifest.json`**: Terraform Registry manifest for provider metadata

## Usage

These workflows will automatically run based on their triggers. For releases:

1. Create and push a git tag:
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

2. The release workflow will automatically:
   - Build the provider for all supported platforms
   - Sign the release artifacts
   - Create a GitHub release
   - Upload all artifacts to the release

The provider will then be available for download and can be published to the Terraform Registry if desired.
