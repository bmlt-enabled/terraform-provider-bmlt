# bmlt_service_body (Resource)

Service body resource

Service bodies represent organizational units within BMLT such as Areas, Regions, or Groups. They have hierarchical relationships and can have administrators and assigned users.

## Example Usage

### Basic Service Body (Area)

```terraform
# Create a basic Area Service Body
resource "bmlt_service_body" "metro_area" {
  name            = "Metro Area"
  description     = "Metropolitan Area Service Committee"
  type            = "AS"  # Area Service
  admin_user_id   = 1
  assigned_user_ids = [1, 2]
}
```

### Service Body with Parent (Region under Area)

```terraform
# Create a parent area first
resource "bmlt_service_body" "metro_area" {
  name              = "Metro Area"
  description       = "Metropolitan Area Service Committee"
  type              = "AS"  # Area Service
  admin_user_id     = 1
  assigned_user_ids = [1]
}

# Create a region under the area
resource "bmlt_service_body" "north_region" {
  name              = "North Region"
  description       = "North Regional Service Committee"
  type              = "RS"  # Regional Service
  parent_id         = bmlt_service_body.metro_area.id
  admin_user_id     = 2
  assigned_user_ids = [2, 3]
}
```

### Complete Service Body Configuration

```terraform
# Complete service body configuration with all optional fields
resource "bmlt_service_body" "complete_area" {
  name              = "Greater Metro Area"
  description       = "Greater Metropolitan Area Service Committee covering multiple districts"
  type              = "AS"
  parent_id         = 1  # Optional parent service body
  admin_user_id     = 10
  assigned_user_ids = [10, 11, 12, 13]
  
  # Contact information
  url      = "https://greatermarea.na.org"
  helpline = "+1-800-266-2262"
  email    = "webservant@greatermarea.na.org"
  
  # World service identifier for integration
  world_id = "GMArea2023"
}
```

### Working with User References

```terraform
# First create the users
resource "bmlt_user" "area_chair" {
  username     = "area.chair"
  password     = var.area_chair_password
  type         = "serviceBodyAdmin"
  display_name = "Area Chairperson"
  description  = "Chairperson for the Area Service Committee"
  email        = "chair@area.na.org"
}

resource "bmlt_user" "area_secretary" {
  username     = "area.secretary"
  password     = var.area_secretary_password
  type         = "serviceBodyAdmin"
  display_name = "Area Secretary"
  description  = "Secretary for the Area Service Committee"
  email        = "secretary@area.na.org"
}

# Then create the service body referencing the users
resource "bmlt_service_body" "area" {
  name              = "Central Area"
  description       = "Central Area Service Committee"
  type              = "AS"
  admin_user_id     = bmlt_user.area_chair.id
  assigned_user_ids = [
    bmlt_user.area_chair.id,
    bmlt_user.area_secretary.id
  ]
  
  url   = "https://central.na.org"
  email = "webservant@central.na.org"
}
```

```

## Notes

- **Hierarchical Structure**: Service bodies can have parent-child relationships. Set `parent_id` to create a hierarchical structure.
